<p>This exercise is about using and modifying an existing class. The</p>

<p>solution contains a new class called Status, in the file Status.cs.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Have a look inside the file Status.cs, and see what the Status
class definition contains. See if you can identify the instance
fields, the constructor, the methods that return information
(accessors), and the methods that change the value of an
instance field (mutators)</p></li>
<li><p>Now try to use the Status class yourself. Insert some code
into the solution (in InsertCodeHere.cs), that does the
following:
a. Creates a new Status object.
b. Prints out some information about the Status object:
The status text, the number of likes, and the number of
dislikes. In order to do this, you need to call some
method on the Status object.
c. Makes some calls of the methods which change the
number of likes and dislikes.
d. Prints out the information again – now you should see
that the information has changed</p></li>
<li><p>After this, we decide that we want to keep track of the
number of times the status has been read. To do this, we
need to add code to the Status class. More specifically, you
need to:
a. Add a new instance field numberOf Reads to store the
number of times a status has been read
b. Update the constructor to give this instance field an
initial value (what seems like an obvious initial value?)
c. Add a new method ReadStatus, that will increase the
number of times the status has been read by one (Hint:
The method will be very similar to the AddOneLike
method)
d. Add a method GetNumberOfReads, that will return the alue of the new instance field
e. Update your test code, so the new methods are tested
as well.</p></li>
<li><p>[Extra – only if you have time] Add a method ReadStatus-
Multiple, that will increase the number of times the status
has been read with a number given by the user (Hint: The
method will then need to take this number as a parameter).</p></li>
</ol>
