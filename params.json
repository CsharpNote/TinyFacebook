The\r\n\r\nsolution contains a new class called Status, in the file Status.cs.\r\n\r\n1. Have a look inside the file Status.cs, and see what the Status\r\nclass definition contains. See if you can identify the instance\r\nfields, the constructor, the methods that return information\r\n(accessors), and the methods that change the value of an\r\ninstance field (mutators)\r\n\r\n2. Now try to use the Status class yourself. Insert some code\r\ninto the solution (in InsertCodeHere.cs), that does the\r\nfollowing:\r\na. Creates a new Status object.\r\nb. Prints out some information about the Status object:\r\nThe status text, the number of likes, and the number of\r\ndislikes. In order to do this, you need to call some\r\nmethod on the Status object.\r\nc. Makes some calls of the methods which change the\r\nnumber of likes and dislikes.\r\nd. Prints out the information again – now you should see\r\nthat the information has changed\r\n\r\n3. After this, we decide that we want to keep track of the\r\nnumber of times the status has been read. To do this, we\r\nneed to add code to the Status class. More specifically, you\r\nneed to:\r\na. Add a new instance field numberOf Reads to store the\r\nnumber of times a status has been read\r\nb. Update the constructor to give this instance field an\r\ninitial value (what seems like an obvious initial value?)\r\nc. Add a new method ReadStatus, that will increase the\r\nnumber of times the status has been read by one (Hint:\r\nThe method will be very similar to the AddOneLike\r\nmethod)\r\nd. Add a method GetNumberOfReads, that will return the alue of the new instance field\r\ne. Update your test code, so the new methods are tested\r\nas well.\r\n\r\n4. [Extra – only if you have time] Add a method ReadStatus-\r\nMultiple, that will increase the number of times the status\r\nhas been read with a number given by the user (Hint: The\r\nmethod will then need to take this number as a parameter).\r\n",
